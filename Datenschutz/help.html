        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
        <p>
            Join is a software solution designed to help teams manage and organize their
            projects using the Kanban methodology. Kanban is a visual workflow management system that originated in the
            manufacturing industry and has since been adapted to various industries, including software development,
            marketing, and project management.

            The key principle of Kanban is to visualize work and limit work in progress (WIP) to improve efficiency and
            productivity. A Kanban board is used to represent the workflow, with columns representing the stages of the
            process and cards representing individual tasks or items. The board is updated in real-time as work
            progresses through the stages.

            By doing so, you can improve your team's efficiency and productivity, while also gaining valuable insights
            into your team's performance.
        </p>

        <h2>How to use it</h2>
        <div class="helpParagraphs">
            <div class="paragraph">
                <h2>1.</h2>
                <p>
                    The first step in using Join is to set up your Kanban board. This involves creating tasks for you
                    and your coworkers which will show your current workflow and active assignments.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <h2>2.</h2>
                <p>
                    The second step is to start moving cards through your workflow. As work progresses, team members
                    should update cards by moving them to the appropriate columns, adding comments, assigning them to
                    team members, and setting due dates. By doing this, everyone on the team can see the status of each
                    task or item in real-time.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <h2>3.</h2>
                <p>
                    The final step in using a Kanban project management tool is to continuously improve your workflow.
                    This involves regularly reviewing your board and identifying areas where you can make improvements.
                    For example, you might notice that certain columns are frequently bottlenecked, in which case you
                    may need to adjust the WIP limit or add more resources to that stage of the process. By making these
                    incremental improvements over time, you can optimize your workflow and improve your team's
                    productivity.
